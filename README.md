# arduino-serial
a pretty simple C# (C-Sharp) app that can send/receive data to Arduino connected by USB
###### Note : it has been build to handle some servos by commands

### How it Works ?
There is 2 files :
 - Form1.cs
 - SerialUtility.cs
`Form1.cs` contains all the code for the window / `SerialUtility.cs` contains code to send/receive data to serialport
In Windows, it connects to COM
